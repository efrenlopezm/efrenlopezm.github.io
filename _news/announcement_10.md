I had an amazing time attending the 43rd IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy :horse:	in-person in San Francisco. Even more after two years of online only conferences. I enjoyed <a href="https://twitter.com/efren_lopezm/status/1529196237777276928" target="blank">catching up</a> with old friends as well. I would not have been able to attend without the support from the Student Travel Grant :moneybag: Thank you to the organizers.
