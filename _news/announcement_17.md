I completed a 3-month long internship at <a href="https://cispa.de/en" target="blank">CISPA</a> in Saarbr√ºcken, Germany :de: working on satellite security research. It was an incredible experience working with my advisors <a target="_blank" href="https://ali-abbasi.info/">Ali Abbasi</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://cispa.de/en/people/c01thho">Thorsten Holz</a>, and all the talented people at CISPA. I was also featured on their Twitter account :blush: <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/CISPA/status/1632672504937316356">&#91;Tweet&#93;</a>.
