I had a blast as a visiting student researcher at the <a href="https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~alacarde/" target="blank">Cy-Phy Security Lab</a> :artificial_satellite:	at <a href="{{ '/assets/video/deer-family.m4v' | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}" target="blank">beatiful UC Santa Cruz</a>. I am humbled to have worked on CPS research with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zbubH9oAAAAJ&hl=en" target="blank">Dr. Álvaro Cárdenas</a> and his amazing team. I am grateful for their hospitality.
