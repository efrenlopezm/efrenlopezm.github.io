I attended the <a href="https://secdev.ieee.org/2023/home" target="blank">IEEE Secure Development Conference</a> in Atlanta, GA. I had the chance to be a tourist in the Georgia Tech campus :honeybee: <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/efren_lopezm/status/1716198792641261822" target="blank">&#91;Photos&#93;</a>. I would not have been able to attend without the support from the Student Travel Grant :moneybag: Thank you to the organizers!
