I really enjoyed virtually attending <a href="https://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2021/" target="blank">ACM CCS</a> this year. I think this year's organizers did a fantastic job. I particularly liked the VOD presentations with both short and long versions available. I hope I get the chance to visit South Korea :kr: and I am looking forward to next year's event in Los Angeles. :star::bear::evergreen_tree:
